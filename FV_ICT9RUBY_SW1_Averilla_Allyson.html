		<br>
		Tanjiro Kamado is a kind teenage boy who lived in the mountains with his family, and took on the responsibilities of his father after his death. One day, after going into town and spending the night at a neighbor's house, he finds that his family has been killed and his younger sister, Nezuko, has become a demon. With the help of Giyuu Tomioka (the Water Hashira), he trains under Sakonji Urokodaki for two years before he takes the exam to become a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps. He passes, and with the help of friends and fellow Demon Slayers, he strives to find a cure for Nezuko.

		<br>
		Nezuko Kamado is Tanjiros' younger sister who gets turned into a demon while protecting her younger brother from being killed. She loses her ability to speak afterwards. And so, as her brother journeys to train (and even when he's already a Demon Slayer), she stays in a wooden box he made for her to protect her from the sunlight which can kill demons. She, like other demons, also has powers which can be useful in battle; some examples are her ability to shapeshift (whether it's to become child-like to fit into a box or turn into an adult), her being ability to heal people with a fire she makes, and many others.

		<h1 style="color: #f8e477">Zenitsu Agatsuma</h1>
		<br>
		Zenitsu Agatsuma is Tanjiro's fellow Demon Slayer whom he meets in one of his earliest missions. He is a very cowardly character, especially compared to Tanjiro. Growing up, he trained under the former Thunder Hashira, but he was only able to master one form from the breathing style. Ever since meeting Tanjiro, Zenitsu has tagged along with him and Nezuko on their missions, only really separating when they have their own missions to attend to. Because of his personality, Zenitsu usually cowers away during fights, but he always passes out - and only then can he kill the demon he's fighting in one swift move.

		<h1 style="color: #121039">Inosuke Hashibira</h1>
		<br>
		Inosuke Hashibira is a rowdy young boy, and another Demon Slayer. His rough and abrasive nature was due to being raised by a boar in the wild for the majority of his childhood. He was in the final exam with Tanjiro and Zenitsu, but he only meets them at the same mission as the two meet each other. That is because he left before the others. Once they all meet, they go on missions together, sometimes with other Demon Slayers or even a Hashira. He uses two swords which he customizes with ragged edges using a rock (a move which angers his swordsmith). He also famously wears a board head and refuses a shirt.

		<h1 style="color: #290026">Kanao Tsuyuri</h1>
		<br>
		Kanao Tsuyuri is the adoptive younger sister of the Kanae and Shinobu Kocho, both of whom are hashiras during their time as Demon Slayers. She is a very quiet person, and an indecisive one too, as she uses a coin and flips them in order to determine a what choice she goes with. That all stems from her rough childhood, where she was raised in poverty and was almost sold into slavery, with no one looking after her until the Kocho sisters adpoted her. She is a very skilled swordsman, even more than Tanjiro, whom she befriends after his time at the Butterfly Mansion where he was recovering from injuries.

		<br>
		Giyuu Tomioka is the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps who finds Tanjiro and Nezuko in the mountains and helps them. By letting a demon escape, he goes under trial but is eventually pardoned by their leader. He has also created a new form for water breathing (which only he knows).

		<br>
		Shinobu is the Butterfly Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps and the older (adoptive) sister of Kanao Tsuyuri. She, unlike other Demon Slayers, cannot cut the neck of a demon due to her short stature. So instead, she uses poisons made out of wisteria (which are also deadly to demons) to kill them.

		<br>
		Kagaya Ubuyashiki is the 97th leader of the Demon Slayer Corps. He has a disease all throughout the series, and that is because of his relation to Muzan, who cursed their bloodline. He pardons Tanjiro, Nezuko, Giyuu, and Urokodaki due to their affiliation with/being a demon, a decision which angered many Demon Slayers and majority of the Hashiras.

		<br>
		Muzan Kibutsuji is the first demon ever created. That was due to him being very sick as a child. But because he was the first demon, that allowed him to be the strongest and gain control of other demons. He turns Nezuko into a demon himself, and after finding out she is immune to sunlight, orders for her to be brought to him so he can gain her power.
